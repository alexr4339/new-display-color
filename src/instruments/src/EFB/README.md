## Electronic Flight Bag (EFB)
Welcome to the electronic flight bag implementation!

### Testing
You can run a standalone version of the EFB by running the following:

```
$ npm install
$ npx webpack server
```

Then, navigate to http://localhost:8080.

The error ```Cannot find module '../util.mjs' or its corresponding type declarations.``` is normal!
