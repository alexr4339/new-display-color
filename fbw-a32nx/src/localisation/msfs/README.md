# locPak Localization

Only change the `en-US.locPak` file. 

The other files are generated automatically from Localazy and any changes will be overwritten.
                                
[//]: # (TODO: GitHub secrets do not work on PRs from forks - check if this workflow is even possible)

Add new keys to the `en-US.locPak` file. These will be automatically added to Localazy and will be available for translation
after the PR has been approved. 

Changes to existing keys will be automatically updated in Localazy once the PR is merged to master. They will be visible 
in the PR build though.
