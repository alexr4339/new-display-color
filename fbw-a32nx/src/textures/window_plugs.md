The window-plugs share the same UV-Map as the base fuselage.
If you wish to plug a window, copy your fuselage base texture into the paint kit and use the alpha guide to plug the desired window.

The following textures are used for the mesh:
A320NEO_AIRFRAME_PLUGS_ALBD.PNG.DDS
A320NEO_AIRFRAME_PLUGS_COMP.PNG.DDS
A320NEO_AIRFRAME_PLUGS_NORM.PNG.DDS
