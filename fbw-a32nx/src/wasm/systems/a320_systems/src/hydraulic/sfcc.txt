Following features are not implemented:
- RS232 protocol
- BITE procedure
- CFDIU integration
- ARINC WrapAround signal

These features are simplified for MSFS:
- CSU only gives only detent signals
- XSFCC signals
- Pin programming only for A320NEO
- Iteration rate not realistic
- Single process for each channel
- No parity check in arinc429.rs
- No A429 transmission failure checks in sfcc.rs
