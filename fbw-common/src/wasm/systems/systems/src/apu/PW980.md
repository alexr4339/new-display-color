Curve fitted polynomial regression generation: http://polynomialregression.drque.net/online.php

Data points based on videos by Haggles with an OAT of 15deg. Note that OAT isn't yet part of the formula,
as we don't know the exact temperature effects on EGT yet (linear or not?). I also suspect there is an altitude
EGT effect (less air density causing higher EGT during start as it provides less cooling?), but that effect is also unknown.
